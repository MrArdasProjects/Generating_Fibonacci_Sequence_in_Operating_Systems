# Generating_Fibonacci_Sequence_in_Operating_Systems
This program uses fork() to create two child processes (P1 and P2). P1 exits after creation, while P2 calculates and prints the Fibonacci result for a user-provided number. The parent process (P0) waits for both child processes to complete before terminating, demonstrating basic process creation and synchronization.
